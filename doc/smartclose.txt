1. About                                                    *smartclose-about*

SmartClose is a wise closing utility. What does it mean? SmartClose plugin
distinguishes two kinds of windows (the regular windows you use to work) and
the auxiliary ones (a preview window, a NERDTree panel, a quickfix window,
etc). Basically, the plugin allows you to close a window just with a single
keystroke (<F10>). But if there are any auxiliary windows visible, it closes
them first (in the LIFO order). It means, you don't have to leave the current
(regular) window to close the auxiliary one. Just hit <F10> and you'll get
it closed. If there are no auxiliary windows visible, <F10> will close the
current window (and a tab if it would be the last window in the tab, or the
editor itself, if it would be the last tab).

If you hit <F10> inside an auxiliary window, the window is closed immediately.
And sometimes, the same behavior could be desired inside regular windows too,
right? Even, if there are visible auxiliary ones, which will have the
precedence, as said before. Therefore, the plugin provides you a configurable
delay time. By default, during the first second after entering a regular
window, hitting <F10> will close that window rather than any auxiliary ones.

In other words, the smart auxiliary windows closing feature is delayed about
1 sec. This way you can move into a regular window you want to close, press
<F10> immediately, and close it even if there are open auxilary windows on the
screen. The delay can be adjusted or even disabled.

2. Usage                                                    *smartclose-usage*

SmartClose has only one command: >

    :SmartClose
<

Also the plugin can define some default mappings if the user wants to.
By default it maps to <F10> in normal, insert, and visual modes.
See |smartclose-configuration| to get some examples.

The banged version forces closing of the current window: >

    :SmartClose!

<

3. Configuration                                    *smartclose-configuration*

SmartClose is extremely handy with command mappings. By default it uses <F10>
like here: >

    nnoremap <silent><F10> :SmartClose<CR>
    vnoremap <silent><F10> :SmartClose<CR>
    inoremap <silent><F10> <C-[>:SmartClose<CR>

<

With these mappings you can hit <F10> any time, not only in normal mode.

Here are some plugin options:


                                             *'smartclose_set_default_mapping'*
Default: 1

Whether SmartClose should set default mappings or not: >

    let g:smartclose_set_default_mapping = 1

<

                                           *'smartclose_set_mapping_with_bang'*
Default: 0

Whether SmartClose should set default mappings with banged version or not: >

    let g:smartclose_set_mapping_with_bang = 0

<

                                             *'smartclose_default_mapping_key'*
Default: '<F10>'

The default mappings key: >

    let g:smartclose_default_mapping_key = '<F10>'

<

                                                           *'smartclose_delay'*
Default: 0

Sets the delay of smart closing auxiliary windows (in miliseconds). After
entering a new window <F10> will start closing auxiliary windows rather than
that window only after this period. By default it's set to 0 (turned off). >

    let g:smartclose_delay = 0

<
